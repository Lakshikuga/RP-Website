                    <h3><b>Research Problem</b></h3>
                    <p>Thanks to the internet and social media, it is now possible to set up a virtual store with relative
ease. Many people have indicated an interest in establishing their businesses as a result of this development. However, they could not keep it running for an extended amount of time due to technical difficulty and other variables. One of the reasons they are failing is because they do not have vital knowledge about sales, income, and early costs, as well as the amount of time it will take to recoup those costs and access to competitive information, among other variables. When confronted with a lack of sales and revenue, most new business owners are forced to close their establishments. The operations of some of these businesses will continue, but after some time, the consumers' interest in the product will fade, and the business will be forced to close its doors. When an individual comes up with a business idea, he or she will not go forward and establish the business because the entrepreneur believes that the firm will not generate enough revenue to justify the investment of his or her time and resources.
Consider the following scenario: the proprietor has a highly demanded product and is a master of innovative advertising. Although the business will be successful soon, most owners will abandon their businesses before seeing significant growth due to a lack of income. It may take some time for a newly opened business to see significant improvements in the sales department. There is no way to predict when sales will begin to increase again. It may be a fantastic and demanding product but abandoning the business before sales improve may not be the best course of action.</p>
<p>According to the sources and the survey results the main problem is with the sales. Current owners and the new owners face this challenge. The owners need to know the following information about their business.
<ul>
    <li>How much profit can be obtained by doing this business?</li>
    <li>How many sales can be obtained by this business?</li>
    <li>What will be the start-up cost for this business?</li>
    <li>What is the possibility of continuing the business?</li></ul>
    
<p>These four sales related questions need to be answered to overcome the fear that the owners have. Answering these questions will motivate the new owner
to start the business, and the current owner will motivate to keep the business going.
In the modern world, customer (small or start-up business) cannot move to the next step without have proper communication and basic knowledge. There are several online platforms available and need to be competing with modern market by keeping of small product is impossible. Therefore, customer’s (small or start-up business) external challenges is the most important to decide the business status.
    External challenges are not scalable to the system.</p>
                    <ul><li>Competition and competitor’s type</li>
                        <li>Trending products</li></ul>
<p>According to the above external challenges, the competition type changes day to day which are small or large type, and the trending is another factor that is decided based on the consumer needs and wants. So, consumer wants also change day to day. Therefore, system should interact with customer or consumer daily. Feedback analyse report should be in current format.</p>
<p>Even though small businesses are starting to use social media marketing for ad creations, the limited financial, time and technological knowledge resources can constraint content creation. Larger companies are more likely to use social media tools than small businesses as they possess resources such as more employees and larger budgets that may enable them to devote further attention to recent technological developments. The lack of knowledge of how to actively engage with customers correctly and creating, vibrant and entertaining content is one of the main problems in ad creation. Using available support tools such as facebook insights, small businesses are not aware of the existence of the tool or not familiar with the efficient use of it. Study demonstrates that small businesses using Social
Media Marketing especially with facebook, involves creating their advertisements manually, where they use media content specially pictures
and text to represent an interesting post which they share on their facebook page. Here, they should take care of textual grammar, spelling errors and the quality of pictures of the post. When it comes to traditional creative templates, human effort is still required to choose templates and select creative elements to fill them up. Study also states, while Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already automated the media buying process, but the advertising creative process still requires extensive human efforts. Manual ad creation process involves picture retouching, material analysis, color blending and layout to be rendered by humans which is very time consuming. Also, in traditional advertising, real-time responsiveness is impossible.</p>
