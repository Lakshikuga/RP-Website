                    <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
                    <p>For starters, minimum resources needed to start a start-up
business are Financial resources, Human resources, Educational resources,
Physical resources, and Emotional resources. Using a considerable amount
of capital and resources is not a wise option. The reason is that starting a
new business is risky such as bankruptcy, financial risk, and political and
environmental risks. New businesses can fail quickly at any time. The
owners must decide whether it is worth taking the risk. So, starting a
business with a small number of resources is better. There are lots of small
businesses that started successfully. Running a business is a challenge. If an
owner survives all these challenges, That owner may expand their business
to a larger organisation. Two sections of owners face these challenges:
current owners and new owners. Why does every business cannot succeed?
This research includes what these challenges are and how to overcome
them.
<p>Gain a solid income is a primary objective of starting a business. If there are
sales, then there is an income. Business owners will get disappointed if there
is no sufficient income from their business. One of the main reasons for not
getting sales is no demand for their selling product. In a situation like this,
the owner can create a demand for their selling product. They can do this by
advertising the product to the right audience in different ways. That is one
way of getting sales. As another way, owners can switch to a new product
that has a good demand. That is the current owner’s perspective. On the

other hand, the new owners or the entrepreneurs are afraid to start their own
business because of the lack of sales. Current owners and new owners can
overcome the lack of sales problems by choosing the correct demanding
    product.</p>
<p>The owner may decide not to change the product and improve the demand
by marketing the product. The best and free marketing technique that
available is social media marketing. In other words, social media
advertising. The free method is limited, and only social media uses can see
it. Business owners can boost their demand by advertising on other
platforms. Such as google AdSense. When it comes to knowledge of
marketing and advertising, all the owners are not very fluent. Even if the
owners are fluent in advertising, creating an ad is a challenging process.
After posting an ad, it requires constant attention because the boosted time
    may be expired.</p>
<p>Suppose the owner has a highly demanding product and has excellent
advertising skills. In this case, that business will be successful in the future,
but before the business is booming, most owners quit their business because
of the lack of income. Newly opened business take some time to improve
on sales section. There is no way to find that when will be their sales will
improve. It may be an excellent, demanding product, but quitting the
    business before improving sales may not be wise.</p>
<p>Time is a crucial thing when doing a business. How much time is sacrificing
to the business has a direct impact on sales. Some owners spare their free
time to build and run the business. On the other hand, some owners use their
full time for the sake of their own business.
Most of the newly opened business owners spare their free time to improve
the sales. When improving sales, communication with the customers plays
a significant role. Customers do not trust a newly opened business. They
                        have many questions.</p> <p>The owner needs to answer every call and answer

every question instantly. A customer may ask simple questions like “what
are your working hours ? “so owners must answer them repeatedly.
After conducting a survey and analysing the results, business owners are
facing these challenges. To overcome these difficulties and boost their
income, owners can use “SalFix” to fix their sales.</p>

                    <h3><b>Literature Survey</b></h3>
                    <p>“SalFix” provides services to both current business owners and entrepreneurs. The system contains four different services. The “SalFix” team surveyed the challenges that owners are facing. After analysing the results figure 2, 80% of the owners fear that they might not get any sales. Another 52% does not do any marketing or social media advertising. 68% of owners are not getting a significant amount of sales the reason is not choosing the correct product. Lack of communication is another challenge. 68% of the owners think they lost their customer base because of poor communication.
One of the main challenges is selecting the correct product to sell. By implementing this solution, Using a collaborative filtering technique, “SalFix” will predict the most demanding product and recommend it to the owner to profit from the business. Apart from the studies conducted before, the main difference of this system is that this will recommend the products to the owners using the geographical locations, cultural differences and seasonal products as well.</p>
<p>Secondly, the owners need to have some idea about the future of the business. The predictions will help the owners to make decisions before something happens [24]. Because of this, the owner’s resources will be saved. The prediction service includes a business intelligence dashboard, and it will provide business solutions as well. Thousands of systems predict sales and income, but “SalFix” can give business solutions such as startup cost and the possibility of continuing the business. That is an added
advantage. Apart from that business intelligence dashboard is capable of data filtering and Drill-down capabilities, a helpful feature for owners. The system will suggest to the owners the future of the business. As mentioned above, this will help the owners to make better decisions.
    Owners do not have a good idea about marketing the product.</p> <p>As mentioned above, 52% of the owners do not use social media advertising. Without marketing, the target audience is small, and selling the product is difficult. “SalFix” provides the service of automated advertisement creation. Using this, owner can create personalised ads. The service includes real-time ads, which is not a common feature of the current products. Comparing with current products, “SalFix” is embedded with detecting ad-click fraud. There are many existing ad creation tools such as the Alibaba’s Luban [18] developed in 2016, where AI technologies are applied in ad design. [18] states that Luban is an advanced designer and it can design 8000 banners every second. This does not state anything about personalized or real time ad creation. The Smart Ads Creator is a free banner maker that builds using HTML5 technology. They live on the business’ website animating visual and textual assets [19]. Facebook Ad manager satisfies the creation of personalized and real time ads but they do not have an automated way of detecting fraud ad-clicks on Facebook ads placed on other websites [22]. states that Facebook takes many steps to reduce the risk of abuse from invalid clicks and help improve the advertiser’s ad performance. They take measures such as capping the number of times any ad is shown to a person, regardless of whether they click on the ad and then Facebook conducts a manual review to determine the nature of the activity.</p> <p>Therefore, using this advertising service, the owners can create and publish ads and market their products with minimal effort. The system is easy to use, and there is no need to provide more attention to marketing the product.
Communication plays a significant role when managing a business. Using the “SalFix” chatbot plugin, this solution can be overcome. The current generation grows with modern technology and depends on it. Therefore,
business owners should provide a modern technical methodology to deliver the best solution for consumers’ expectations. In this case, the consumers are expecting solutions with one touch. So, the system should provide a solution to the user to get with no wait. Therefore, the system needs to analyse and provide the best instant solution for the customer. However, the problem is human resources, and it yields many costs for the company. Using modern technology, we can analyse problems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning, automation problems using Artificial Intelligence. Communication and Feedbacks are the best inputs for the business and using modern techniques. Therefore, designing a chatbot increase the efficiency of communication between the owner and consumer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it provides a feedback system with the help of the SWOT analysis. Feedback always brings brief ideas about the final product, but in this case, it brings about and from consumers or small business owners. In extra, chatbot and feedback help provide key ideas to customers or small businesses for future progression.
Team “SalFix” is developed this web application to overcome the challenges that business owners face. This application will help the owners to save time and other resources when running a business. Most importantly, this web application will help owners to make the correct decisions about the business.</p>
