                    <h3><b>Research Gap</b></h3>
                    <ul><li>Business Intelligence Dashboard</li>
                    <p>Technology has the potential to benefit everyone and every business on the planet. Because of technology, "SalFix" can help the owners to overcome this fear.
Everybody these days has access to mobile phones, laptop computers, and the internet. "SalFix" is a web-based application that assists business owners in overcoming this challenge. There is a considerable number of systems and services available to solve the sales problem. However, all are focused on large companies and organisations. As mentioned in the introduction, a small business owner only has a limited number of resources. Those systems and services are not cheap, and small business owners cannot afford them. So, affordability is a primary concern in "SalFix".
With the "SalFix" web application, owners can predict the sales and income for the following year. The focus is not only to predict the sales and income of the current business owners. "SalFix" will provide business solutions as well. Inside these business solutions, the owners can make decisions about the business. The possibility of continuing the business question will be addressed with this business solution. It will motivate the owners to continue the same business or change the business. Furthermore, for the new owners as a business solution, they can get an estimated business startup cost. "SalFix" help the new owners to get an idea about the outcome and the sales of the current business. In providing these solutions and predictive services, the primary goal is to inspire entrepreneurs to start their businesses while also guaranteeing that existing business owners receive a solid income due to their efforts. On top of all that, this is affordable. There is no research declared on new owners. In sales prediction research, it should include these.</p>
                    
                   <ul><li>Prediction of the income.</li>
                       <li>Prediction of sales.</li>
                       <li>Possibility of continuing the business.</li>
                       <li>Prediction of the starting cost of a business.</li>
                       <li>View everything in a BI dashboard.</li>
                    
                    
                    </ul>
                        
                        <p></p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img src="images/tavish_gap.png" class="diagram_gap">
                        </div>
                    
                        
                        <p></p>
                <p>The above table illustrates the research gap that there is research that can predict the profit and the sales but not the possibility of continuing the business, the starting cost, and the BI dashboard. The article 1 shows that it has the BI dashboard, but another two components are missing.</p>
                    </ul>    
                    
                    <ul><li>Chatbot with Feedback</li><p>Today the small business owners are facing trouble in earning profit maximization. Profit is calculated by subtracting the business’ total expenses from the total revenue. Every small business should minimize the expenses of the business. What are the expenses in business? The expenses are depending on how seller deliver the final output to the end user. How can seller minimize or reduce the expenses? The only way is controlling the cost. 
The communication with the end-user is much needed activity for running the business successfully. Information is priceless asset to the modern world market. Here, the information means the list of thoughts about product that deliver from consumer. Information contains the feelings, ratings, knowledge, interest, and feedbacks of consumer. These are the assets and business can use this data for future works. [23] But in this modern world the small business struggling to get advice from a good guidance because of the huge competition in the market. 
The following problems are to be considered by small business:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul><li>Getting touch with buyers.</li>

<p>The business’s revenue medium is the buyers. So, business should understand the thoughts of the buyers. Here buyers mean end-user or consumer. They are consuming the final product and they will use in real world. So, they might have likes and dislike on the final product. The buyers should get to know that likes and dislikes. Then only they can survive in modern market. But the problem is, how to be getting touch with customer? And what are the medium should be used for that? These are the main problem to real world small business.
</p>
                            
                            <li>How get to know the consumer’s thoughts?</li>

                            <p>Another problem is getting know about the consumer’s thought. Answer to this question is easy but implementing in real world is very complex. If we want to get the thoughts of the customer business should maintain a good relation and communication. In the real world this step might be decided by customer. But business should make the bridge to solve the issue. Building a relationship between the consumer we can follow old method, but those methods are offering with limited service.</p>

                            <li>Selecting communication options</li>

                            <p>The major problem is select the best communication option. Selected communication option should be without any interruption customer can be able communicate with business. But in the modern world there are many social media and messaging application available to share the information. But the problem is security, confidentiality and reliability levels are low. Therefore, in the real world the business show hesitated to the social media messaging platform.</p>
                            <li>Deliver the service without any limitation</li>

                            <p>The portal or platform should run without any limitation. Limitations means while deliver a service, the platform only provides services with limitations such as limited time to communicate with B2C and C2B concept. Its factors might be based on the time, resources, security and financial. Therefore, the business should consider this points to while business activity. If the convenient to get use communication platform with some limitations, there is no worth. Simply, it is useless.</p>

                            <li>Maintain a human resource cost for communication with customer</li>

                            <p>After the successful platform deployment business should maintain the employees for the communication with customer. Reason is conversation between the business and customer will be in human language. So, there must need a person to understand the questions of customer. Therefore, the business should care and maintain the employees for this service. But here, increasing cost to business. So, may be affects the productivity of final output.</p>

                            <li>Delivery of different services through the platform between the customers</li>

                            <p>The business always looking for reduce the expenses. Therefore, their all services and products are should delivery with platform. They do not interest to deliver like services are on various time and products are on another time. So, they expect the one touch concept. It means, all the services and the product should deliver under a process. For example- Customer services, Information Technology Services, Business and Product Marketing and Selling Services. These are the services business expecting to deliver to customer with one touch. If all above services integrated into one platform, then they can reduce the expenses too. This issue always addresses by big and small businesses. </p>

                            <li>Identify the SWOT analysis and integrate with system</li>

                            <p>All businesses are running with strength, weaknesses, threat, and opportunity. If business stay long in the modern market, then they need to know about their all things in business environment. So, for that they need to do brief analysis about the SWOT. This describes how the business is worthy to stay long in the modern market. The concept behind is they should understand their self-first and then only move to business activity. In this case, business can reduce the risk level by identifying the threats. So, the SWOT analysis is needed to do frequently. This method will directly yield to the key ideas and innovations. </p>

                            <li>Self-defense against competitors</li>

                            <p>This marketing world is filled with competition. Earning profits without competition is impossible. The business should prepare to competitive with the many competitors. Sometimes competitors will be big business or small business. So, the business should understand the environment of competition and SWOT concept is very helpful to this process. The business how to defense against the competitors when they in down stage? This question is more important. Business’ main goal is profit maximization and long live in the modern market. So, the solution to the above question is more important to the small business.</p>

                            <li>Get feedbacks and gathering information</li>

<p>Getting feedback is the final stage of the process. This is a stage for increasing in future sales and profit. How is important to getting the feedbacks from the customer? This question always depends on the customer. Consumer is the asset of the any business. Therefore, business should protect this asset. Consumer feedback information are priceless, so they need to collect those stuffs for future works. They need to record the data day to day. How can we gather the information from customer? This another important argument in the real business world.

                        <p>As the above table shows that our system is how different from the existing system with the factor of problem solving, threats & weakness, task allocation and history. The mainly focused on the analysis from the chat and feedback and providing reports. According to that giving some key ideas and tips to the customers.</p>
                    
                    
                    </ul>
                    
                    
                    <ul><li>Automated ad image creation system </li>
                    <p>There are existing systems which automate the advertisement design process such as Alibaba's Luban, developed in 2016, where AI technologies are applied in ad design. Research A states that Luban is an advanced designer and is able to design 8000 banners every second. This does not state anything about personalized or real time ad creation. Research B Smart Ads Creator is a free banner maker that builds using HTML5 technology. They live on the business’ website animating visual and textual assets. Research C, Facebook Ad manager satisfies all parameters mentioned in Table 1.0 but they do not provide a feature to detect ad-click fraud of the ads displayed in facebook. Facebook takes several steps to reduce the risk of abuse from invalid clicks and help improve user’s ad performance such as capping the number of times any ad is shown to a person, regardless of whether they click on the ad. This does not state any detection model used by Facebook to identify click fraud. If facebook detects or are alerted to suspicious or potentially invalid click activity, a manual review is performed to determine the nature of the activity.
The proposed solution will generate personalized and real time ads specific to a customer. To be able to do personalization, it has to generate many creative designs. It will also provide a service to detect ad-click fraud on ads which are placed in third party websites when a user visits that site and tailored ads are shown to him.
